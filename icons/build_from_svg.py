"""Turns the icon pack's SVG sources into Android vector drawables.

This replaces the tracing the drawables were built by. The artwork first
arrived as 512px PNGs, so it had to be traced; the SVG sources are the same
drawings with their real geometry, at the 24dp grid they were drawn on. A
trace of a raster is an approximation that happens to be a very good one --
the shapes are flat colour, so it reproduced them closely -- but it is still
an approximation, and it produced files ten times the size for the privilege.

Nothing is redrawn here. An Android vector's pathData takes SVG path syntax
as it stands, so every path crosses over verbatim; the only things this does
are recolour, flatten what Android would need extra machinery for, and drop
clips that clip nothing.

This is the OLO family's shared symbol build. Every app builds the same tiles
and flat glyphs from the one copy of the sources here, rather than keeping its
own fork of the pack.

Usage:
    python3 icons/build_from_svg.py                      # preview into icons/build/
    python3 icons/build_from_svg.py --out PATH/res/drawable   # straight into an app

An app points --out at its own `app/src/main/res/drawable`; the sources and
the recolour table stay here and are not copied into the app tree.
